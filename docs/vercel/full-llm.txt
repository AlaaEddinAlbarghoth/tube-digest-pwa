Using the REST API
Copy page
Interact programmatically with your Vercel account using the SDK or direct HTTP requests.
Copy page
To view all endpoints, and explore code examples with the SDK and direct API calls, see the
reference endpoints documentation
.

You can deploy new versions of web applications, manage custom domains, retrieve information about deployments, and manage secrets and environment variables for projects.

The API supports any programming language or framework that can send HTTP requests.

To interact with the API, you can:

Use the Vercel SDK
 by first instantiating with your token

Use the language of your choice by calling the endpoints directly and
providing your token

​
API Basics

Our API is exposed as an HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 service over SSL. All endpoints live under the URL
https://api.vercel.com
 and then generally follow the REST architecture.

​
Server Specs

​
HTTP and TLS

The API supports HTTP versions 1, 1.1, and 2, although HTTP/2 is preferred.

TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3 are supported, with resumption.

For more information on TLS support, refer to the SSL Labs report.

​
Content Type

All requests must be encoded as JSON with the Content-Type: application/json header. If not otherwise specified, responses from the Vercel API, including errors, are encoded exclusively as JSON as well.

​
Authentication

Vercel Access Tokens are required to authenticate and use the Vercel API.

Copy
Ask AI
  Authorization
:
Bearer
 <
TOKEN
>

​
Creating an Access Token

Access Tokens can be created and managed from inside your
account settings
.

In the upper-right corner of your
dashboard
, click your profile picture, then select
Account Settings
 or go to the
Tokens page directly

Select
Tokens
 from the sidebar

From
Create Token
 section, enter a descriptive name for the token

Choose the scope from the list of Teams in the drop-down menu. The scope ensures that only your specified Team(s) can use an Access Token

From the drop-down, select an expiration date for the Token

Click
Create Token

Once you’ve created an Access Token, securely store the value as it will not be shown again.

​
Expiration

Setting an expiration date on an Access Token is highly recommended and is considered one of the standard security practices that helps keep your information secure. You can select from a default list of expiration dates ranging from 1 day to 1 year. You can view the expiration date of your Access Tokens on the
tokens page.

​
Accessing Resources Owned by a Team

By default, you can access resources contained within your own user account (personal).

To access resources owned by a team, or create a project for a
specific
 team, you must first find the
Team ID
.

After you obtained the Team ID, append it as a query string at the end of the API endpoint URL:

Copy
Ask AI
https
:
//api.vercel.com/v6/deployments?teamId=[teamID]

​
Failed Authentication

If authentication is unsuccessful for a request, the
error status code

403
 is returned.

​
Types

The following is a list of the types of data used within the Vercel API:

Name
Definition
Example
ID
A unique value used to identify resources.
"V0fra8eEgQwEpFhYG2vTzC3K"
String
A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.
"value"
Integer
An integer is a number without decimals.
1234
Float
A float is a number with decimals.
12.34
Map
A data structure with a list of values assigned to a unique key.
{ "key": "value" }
List
A data structure with only a list of values separated by a comma.
["value", 1234, 12.34]
Enum
An Enum is a String with only a few possible valid values.
A
 or
B
Date
An Integer representing a date in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.
1540095775941
IsoDate
A String representing a date in the 8601 format.
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ
Boolean
A Boolean is a type of two possible values representing true or false.
true

​
Pagination

When the API response includes an array of records, a pagination object is returned when the total number of records present is greater than the limit per request. The default value of this limit is 20 but it can be changed by passing a value to the query parameter
limit
 when the request is made. The maximum possible value of
limit
 is 100.

You can then use the pagination object to make additional requests and obtain all the records.

The pagination object is structured as shown in the example below:

pagination-structure
Copy
Ask AI
{

  "pagination"
: {

    "count"
:
20
,
//Amount of items in the current page.

    "next"
:
1555072968396
,
//Timestamp that must be used to request the next page.

    "prev"
:
1555413045188
 //Timestamp that must be used to request the previous page.

  }

}

In order to obtain the records for the next batch, perform the following actions:

Send a request to the same API endpoint

Include the query parameter
until
 with a value equal to the timestamp value of
next
 returned in the previous request

Repeat this sequence until the pagination object has a
next
 value of
null

This is an example of applying this sequence with
Node.js
 to save all the projects in your personal account to a
json
 file:

pagination-example.js
Copy
Ask AI
const
 axios
 =
 require
(
'axios'
);

const
 fs
 =
 require
(
'fs'
);

const
 vercelToken
 =
 'yourtokenvalue'
;
//Replace with your token

const
 apiEndPt
 =
 'https://api.vercel.com/v9/projects'
;

let
 config
 =
 {

  method:
 'get'
,

  url:
 apiEndPt
,

  headers:
 {

    Authorization:
 'Bearer '
 +
 vercelToken
,

  },

};

let
 results
 =
 [];

(
function
 loop
() {

  axios
(
config
)

    .
then
(
function
 (
response
) {

      results
.
push
(
...
response
.
data
.
projects
);

      if
 (
response
.
data
.
pagination
.
next
 !==
 null
) {

        config
.
url
 =
 `
${
apiEndPt
}
?until=
${
response
.
data
.
pagination
.
next
}
`
;

        loop
();

      }
else
 {

        //you can use the final results object and for example save it to a json file

        fs
.
writeFileSync
(
'projects.json'
,
JSON
.
stringify
(
results
));

      }

    })

    .
catch
(
function
 (
error
) {

      console
.
log
(
error
);

    });

})();

​
Rate Limits

We limit the number of calls you can make over a certain period of time.
Rate limits vary and are specified by the following header in all responses:

Header
Description
X-RateLimit-Limit
The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make.
X-RateLimit-Remaining
The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
X-RateLimit-Reset
The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds.

When the rate limit is
exceeded
, an error is returned with the status “
429 Too Many Requests
”:

error-response
Copy
Ask AI
{

  "error"
: {

    "code"
:
"too_many_requests"
,

    "message"
:
"Rate limit exceeded"

  }

}

You can find the complete list of rate limits in the
limits
documentation
.

​
Versioning

All endpoints and examples are designated with a specific version. Versions vary per endpoint and are not global.

The response shape of a certain endpoint is not guaranteed to be fixed over time. In particular, we might add new keys to responses without bumping a version endpoint, which will be noted in the changelog.

To ensure the security and correctness of your application, make sure to only read the keys from the response that your application needs. Don’t proxy entire responses to third-parties without validation.

Old versions of each endpoint are supported for as long as possible. When we intend to deprecate, we will notify users in the changelog section.

Endpoint versions follow the base URL and come before the endpoint. For example:

version-endpoint
Copy
Ask AI
https
:
//api.vercel.com/v6/deployments`

This examples uses version
6
 of the
deployments
endpoint
.

SSO Token Exchange
Copy page
During the autorization process, Vercel sends the user to the provider
redirectLoginUrl
, that includes the OAuth authorization
code
 parameter. The provider then calls the SSO Token Exchange endpoint with the sent code and receives the OIDC token. They log the user in based on this token and redirects the user back to the Vercel account using deep-link parameters included the redirectLoginUrl. Providers should not persist the returned
id_token
 in a database since the token will expire. See
Authentication with SSO
 for more details.

Upload Deployment Files
Copy page
Before you create a deployment you need to upload the required files for that deployment. To do it, you need to first upload each file to this endpoint. Once that’s completed, you can create a new deployment with the uploaded files. The file content must be placed inside the body of the request. In the case of a successful response you’ll receive a status code 200 with an empty body.

Dangerously delete by source image
Copy page
Marks a source image as deleted, causing cache entries associated with that source image to be revalidated in the foreground on the next request. Use this method with caution because one source image can be associated with many paths and deleting the cache can cause many concurrent requests to the origin leading to cache stampede problem. A good use case for deleting the cache is when the origin has also been deleted, for example it returns a 404 or 410 status code.

integrations
Create integration store (free and paid plans)
Copy page
Creates an integration store for both FREE and PAID billing plans. This simplified endpoint automatically provisions real integration storage resources while handling billing complexity behind the scenes. It supports both free and paid billing plans with automatic authorization creation for paid resources. ## How it works 1. Validates the integration configuration and product 2. For free resources: Auto-discovers available free billing plans 3. For paid resources: Creates billing authorization inline using provided billingPlanId 4. Provisions real resources through the Vercel Marketplace 5. Returns the created store with connection details ## Workflow Before using this endpoint, discover available products and billing plans: 1. List your configurations:
GET /v1/integrations/configurations
 2. Get products for a configuration:
GET /v1/integrations/configuration/{id}/products
 3. Get billing plans for a product:
GET /integrations/integration/{integrationId}/products/{productId}/plans
 4. Review the
metadataSchema
 for each product to understand required metadata 5. Create storage with discovered product:
POST /v1/storage/stores/integration/direct
 ## Usage Patterns -
Free resources
: Omit
billingPlanId
 - endpoint will auto-discover free plans -
Paid resources
: Provide
billingPlanId
 from billing plans discovery -
Prepayment plans
: Also provide
prepaymentAmountCents
 for variable amount plans ## Limitations -
Admin access required
: Only integration configuration admins can create stores -
Storage limits apply
: Subject to your team’s storage quotas -
Payment method required
: For paid plans, ensure valid payment method is configured ## Error Responses -
400 Bad Request
: Invalid input, no plans available, or billing issues -
403 Forbidden
: Insufficient permissions (non-admin users) -
404 Not Found
: Integration configuration or product not found -
429 Too Many Requests
: Rate limit exceeded

List products for integration configuration
Copy page
Lists all products available for an integration configuration. Use this endpoint to discover what integration products are available for your integration configuration. The returned product IDs or slugs can then be used with storage provisioning endpoints like
POST /v1/storage/stores/integration/direct
. ## Workflow 1. Get your integration configurations:
GET /v1/integrations/configurations
 2.
Use this endpoint
: Get products for a configuration:
GET /v1/integrations/configuration/{id}/products
 3. Create storage resource:
POST /v1/storage/stores/integration/direct
 ## Response Returns an array of products with their IDs, slugs, names, supported protocols, and metadata requirements. Each product represents a different type of resource you can provision. The
metadataSchema
 field contains a JSON Schema that defines: -
Required metadata
: Fields that must be provided during storage creation -
Optional metadata
: Fields that can be provided but are not mandatory -
Field validation
: Data types, allowed values, and constraints Use this schema to validate metadata before calling the storage creation endpoint.

Create Event
Copy page
Partner notifies Vercel of any changes made to an Installation or a Resource. Vercel is expected to use
list-resources
 and other read APIs to get the new state.

resource.updated
 event should be dispatched when any state of a resource linked to Vercel is modified by the partner.

installation.updated
 event should be dispatched when an installation’s billing plan is changed via the provider instead of Vercel.

 Resource update use cases:

 - The user renames a database in the partner’s application. The partner should dispatch a
resource.updated
 event to notify Vercel to update the resource in Vercel’s datastores.
 - A resource has been suspended due to a lack of use. The partner should dispatch a
resource.updated
 event to notify Vercel to update the resource’s status in Vercel’s datastores.

Submit Invoice
Copy page
This endpoint allows the partner to submit an invoice to Vercel. The invoice is created in Vercel’s billing system and sent to the customer. Depending on the type of billing plan, the invoice can be sent at a time of signup, at the start of the billing period, or at the end of the billing period.

 Use the
credentials.access_token
 we provided in the
Upsert Installation
 body to authorize this request.
 There are several limitations to the invoice submission:

 1. A resource can only be billed once per the billing period and the billing plan.
 2. The billing plan used to bill the resource must have been active for this resource during the billing period.
 3. The billing plan used must be a subscription plan.
 4. The interim usage data must be sent hourly for all types of subscriptions. See
Send subscription billing and usage data
 API on how to send interim billing and usage data.

Update Resource Secrets
Copy page
This endpoint updates the secrets of a resource. If a resource has projects connected, the connected secrets are updated with the new secrets. The old secrets may still be used by existing connected projects because they are not automatically redeployed. Redeployment is a manual action and must be completed by the user. All new project connections will use the new secrets.

 Use cases for this endpoint:

 - Resetting the credentials of a database in the partner. If the user requests the credentials to be updated in the partner’s application, the partner post the new set of secrets to Vercel, the user should redeploy their application and the expire the old credentials.

Create project transfer request
Copy page
Initiates a project transfer request from one team to another.
 Returns a
code
 that remains valid for 24 hours and can be used to accept the transfer request by another team using the
PUT /projects/transfer-request/:code
 endpoint.
 Users can also accept the project transfer request using the claim URL:
https://vercel.com/claim-deployment?code=<code>&returnUrl=<returnUrl>
.
 The
code
 parameter specifies the project transfer request code generated using this endpoint.
 The
returnUrl
 parameter redirects users to a specific page of the application if the claim URL is invalid or expired.

Disable Rolling Releases for a project means that future deployments will not undergo a rolling release. Changing the config never alters a rollout that’s already in-flight—it only affects the next production deployment. If you want to also stop the current rollout, call this endpoint to disable the feature, and then call either the /complete or /abort endpoint.

Update (or disable) Rolling Releases for a project. Changing the config never alters a rollout that’s already in-flight. It only affects the next production deployment. This also applies to disabling Rolling Releases. If you want to also stop the current rollout, call this endpoint to disable the feature, and then call either the /complete or /abort endpoint. Note: Enabling Rolling Releases automatically enables skew protection on the project with the default value if it wasn’t configured already.

If the principal delegated its authority (for example, a user delegating to an app), then this array contains the ID of the current actor. For example, if
principalId
 is "user123" and
viaIds
 is
["app456"]
, we can say the event was triggered by - "app456 on behalf of user123", or - "user123 via app4556". Both are equivalent. Arbitrarily long chains of delegation can be represented. For example, if
principalId
 is "user123" and
viaIds
 is
["service1", "service2"]
, we can say the event was triggered by "user123 via service1 via service2".

​
Generic Errors

These error codes are consistent for all endpoints.

​
Forbidden

You’re not authorized to use the endpoint. This usually happens due to missing an user token.

Similar to the HTTP 403 Forbidden error.

error-response-forbidden
Copy
Ask AI
{

  "error"
: {

    "code"
:
"forbidden"
,

    "message"
:
"Not authorized"

  }

}

​
Rate Limited

You exceeded the maximum allotted requests.

The limit of request is per endpoint basis so you could continue using another endpoints even if some of them give you this error.

error-response-rate-limited
Copy
Ask AI
{

  "error"
: {

    "code"
:
"rate_limited"
,

    "message"
:
"The rate limit of 6 exceeded for 'api-www-user-update-username'. Try again in 7 days"
,

    "limit"
: {

      "remaining"
:
0
,

      "reset"
:
1571432075
,

      "resetMs"
:
1571432075563
,

      "total"
:
6

    }

  }

}

​
Bad Request

There was an error with the request, the
error.message
 would contain information about the issue.

error-response-bad-request
Copy
Ask AI
{

  "error"
: {

    "code"
:
"bad_request"
,

    "message"
:
"An english description of the error that just occurred"

  }

}

​
Internal Server Error

This errors is similar to the HTTP 500 Internal Server Error error code.

error-response-internal-server-error
Copy
Ask AI
{

  "error"
: {

    "code"
:
"internal_server_error"
,

    "message"
:
"An unexpected internal error occurred"

  }

}

​
Resource Not Found

The requested resource could not be found

error-response-not-Found
Copy
Ask AI
{

  "error"
: {

    "code"
:
"not_found"
,

    "message"
:
"Could not find the RESOURCE: ID"

  }

}

​
Method Unknown

The endpoint you’re requesting does not handle the method you defined. The error message will contain the methods the endpoint responds to.

error-response-method-unknown
Copy
Ask AI
{

  "error"
: {

    "code"
:
"method_unknown"
,

    "message"
:
"This endpoint only responds to METHOD"

  }

}

Copy
Ask AI
import
 {
Vercel
 }
from
 '@vercel/sdk'
;

const
 vercel
 =
 new
 Vercel
({

  bearerToken:

          },

        ],

        action:
 {

          mitigate:

          },

        },

      },

    },

  });

}

insertCustomRule
()

​
Modify existing rules

In this example, you update an existing custom rule’s configuration. This is useful When you need to programmatically adjust conditions, actions, or status of an existing rule.

run.ts
Copy
Ask AI
import
 {
Vercel
 }
from
 "@vercel/sdk"
;

const
 vercel
 =
 new
 Vercel
({

  bearerToken:
 process
.
env
.
VERCEL_TOKEN
,

});

async
 function
 updateExistingRule
() {

  await
 vercel
.
security
.
updateFirewallConfig
({

    projectId:
 "your-project-id"
,

    teamId:
 "your-team-id"
,
//Not required but sometimes needed if the endpoint requires that you authenticate as a specific team - your token should also have access to this scope

    requestBody:
 {

      action:
 "rules.update"
,

      id:
 "existing-rule-id"
,
//You can find the id by using the rules array of the Read Firewall Configuration endpoint

      value:
 {

        active:
 true
,

        name:
 "Updated Rule Name"
,

        description:
 "Updated rule description"
,

        conditionGroup:
 [

          {

            conditions:
 [

              {

                op:
 "pre"
,

                type:
 "path"
,

                value:
 "/admin"
,

              },

            ],

          },

        ],

        action:
 {

          mitigate:
 {

            action:
 "challenge"
,
// Changed from previous setting

            rateLimit:
 null
,

            redirect:
 null
,

            actionDuration:
 null
,

          },

        },

      },

    },

  });

}

updateExistingRule
()

​
Delete custom rules

In this example, you delete an existing custom rule.

run.ts
Copy
Ask AI
import
 {
Vercel
 }
from
 "@vercel/sdk"
;

const
 vercel
 =
 new
 Vercel
({

  bearerToken:
 process
.
env
.
VERCEL_TOKEN
,

});

async
 function
 deleteRule
() {

  await
 vercel
.
security
.
updateFirewallConfig
({

    projectId:
 "your-project-id"
,

    teamId:
 "your-team-id"
,
//Not required but sometimes needed if the endpoint requires that you authenticate as a specific team - your token should also have access to this scope

    requestBody:
 {

      action:
 "rules.remove"
,

      id:
 "rule-to-delete-id"
,
//You can find the id by using the rules array of the Read Firewall Configuration endpoint

      value:
 null
,
// No value needed for deletion

    },

  });

}

deleteRule
()

​
Change rule priority

This parameter applies when you have more than one custom rule in your project. By default, the priority is determined based on the order in which the rules are added. You can change this in the Vercel dashboard by re-ordering the rules in the
Firewall Configure
 project page
or
 by using the endpoint below.

run.ts
Copy
Ask AI
import
 {
Vercel
 }
from
 "@vercel/sdk"
;

const
 vercel
 =
 new
 Vercel
({

  bearerToken:
 process
.
env
.
VERCEL_TOKEN
,

});

async
 function
 reorderRules
() {

  await
 vercel
.
security
.
updateFirewallConfig
({

    projectId:
 "your-project-id"
,

    teamId:
 "your-team-id"
,
//Not required but sometimes needed if the endpoint requires that you authenticate as a specific team - your token should also have access to this scope

    requestBody:
 {

      action:
 "rules.priority"
,

      id:
 "rule-to-update-priority-id"
,
//You can find the id by using the rules array of the Read Firewall Configuration endpoint

      value:
 1
,
//Use the rules array of the Read Firewall Configuration endpoint to determine what array position you would like this rule to move to. The minimum is 0 and the maximum is the length of the array

    },

  });

}

reorderRules
()

​
Custom system bypass rule

The
WAF system bypass rules
 allow you to have specific IP addresses or CIDRs bypass the system-level mitigations such as
DDoS Mitigation
. For more complex filters, you can use REST API directly.

For example, to allow mobile applications to bypass the system-level mitigations, use the following code to create a
Custom Rule
 in your project. This condition will match mobile devices as well as other clients that emit mobile
user_agent
 values.

Bypassing system-level mitigations with the API is currently in beta. Contact
support
 if you would like to use it.

run.ts
Copy
Ask AI
import
 {
Vercel
 }
from
 "@vercel/sdk"
;

const
 vercel
 =
 new
 Vercel
({

  bearerToken:
 "<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE>"
,

});

async
 function
 run
() {

  const
 result
 =
 await
 vercel
.
security
.
updateFirewallConfig
({

    projectId:
 "<your_project_id>"
,

    teamId:
 "team_1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l"
,

    requestBody:
 {

      action:
 "rules.insert"
,

      id:
 null
,

      value:
 {

        name:
 "Mobile App Bypass Security Rule"
,

        description:
 "Custom system bypass rule targeting mobile applications"
,

        active:
 true
,

        conditionGroup:
 [

          {

            conditions:
 [

              {

                type:
 "user_agent"
,

                op:
 "re"
,

                neg:
 false
,

                value:
 "Mobile|Android|iPhone|iPad"

              }

            ]

          }

        ],

        action:
 {

          mitigate:
 {

            action:
 "bypass"
,

            bypassSystem:
 true

          }

        }

      }

    },

  });

  // Handle the result

  console
.
log
(
result
);

}

run
();

​
Update an OWASP rule

In this example, you update a specific rule from the
OWASP ruleset
 in your project using
crs.update
. You specify the rule to update by using its name in the
id
 field.

run.ts
Copy
Ask AI
import
 {
Vercel
 }
from
 "@vercel/sdk"
;

const
 vercel
 =
 new
 Vercel
({

  bearerToken:
 process
.
env
.
VERCEL_TOKEN
,

});

async
 function
 updateOwaspRule
() {

  await
 vercel
.
security
.
updateFirewallConfig
({

    projectId:
 "your-project-id"
,

    teamId:
 "your-team-id"
,
// Not required in all cases

    requestBody:
 {

      action:
 "crs.update"
,

      id:
 "xss"
,
// eg. "sd", "max", "lfi", "rfi", "rce", "php", "gen", "xss", "sqli", "sf", "java"

      value:
 {

        active:
 true
,
// Enable the rule

        action:
 "log"
,
// e.g. "deny" | "log"

      },

    },

  });

}

updateOwaspRule
()

​
Disable all OWASP rules

This example disables all
OWASP rules
 for the project. It is a shortcut equivalent to setting every OWASP rule to
active = false
.

run.ts
Copy
Ask AI
import
 {
Vercel
 }
from
 "@vercel/sdk"
;

const
 vercel
 =
 new
 Vercel
({

  bearerToken:
 process
.
env
.
VERCEL_TOKEN
,

});

async
 function
 disableOWASPRules
() {

  await
 vercel
.
security
.
updateFirewallConfig
({

    projectId:
 "your-project-id"
,

    teamId:
 "your-team-id"
,
// Not required in all cases

    requestBody:
 {

      action:
 "crs.disable"
,

      id:
 null
,

      value:
 null
,

    },

  });

}

disableOWASPRules
()

​
Update a managed ruleset

Use
managedRules.update
  with the ruleset name as
id
 to enable/disable the ruleset and update the firewall action for that
managed ruleset
 for the project.

run.ts
Copy
Ask AI
import
 {
Vercel
 }
from
 "@vercel/sdk"
;

const
 vercel
 =
 new
 Vercel
({

  bearerToken:
 process
.
env
.
VERCEL_TOKEN
,

});

async
 function
 updateManagedRuleset
() {

  await
 vercel
.
security
.
updateFirewallConfig
({

    projectId:
 "your-project-id"
,

    teamId:
 "your-team-id"
,
// Not required in all cases

    requestBody:
 {

      action:
 "managedRules.update"
,

      id:
 "bot_protection"
,
// eg. "owasp", "bot_protection", "ai_bots", "bot_filter"

      value:
 {

        active:
 true
,
// Enable the ruleset

        action:
 "log"
,
// e.g. "deny" | "log" | "challenge"

      },

    },

  });

}

​
Updating your project’s rolling release configuration

In this example, you configure rolling releases for your project with multiple stages. This allows you to gradually roll out deployments to production, starting with a small percentage of traffic and progressively increasing it.

run.ts
Copy
Ask AI
import
 {
Vercel
 }
from
 "@vercel/sdk"
;

const
 vercel
 =
 new
 Vercel
({

  bearerToken:
 process
.
env
.
VERCEL_TOKEN
,

});

async
 function
 setRollingReleaseConfig
() {

  const
 result
 =
 await
 vercel
.
rollingRelease
.
updateRollingReleaseConfig
({

    idOrName:
 "your-project-id"
,
// Can be project ID or URL-encoded project name

    teamId:
 "team_1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l"
,
// Optional - required if your token is scoped to multiple teams

    slug:
 "my-team-url-slug"
,
// Optional - alternative to teamId

    requestBody:
 {

      target:
 "production"
,

      stages:
 [

        {

          targetPercentage:
 5
,
// Start with 5% of traffic

          duration:
 300
           // Wait 5 minutes before next stage

        },

        {

          targetPercentage:
 25
,
// Then 25% of traffic

          duration:
 600
           // Wait 10 minutes

        },

        {

          targetPercentage:
 50
,
// Then 50% of traffic

          duration:
 900
           // Wait 15 minutes if approved

        },

        {

          targetPercentage:
 100
,
// Finally, 100% of traffic

        }

      ]

    }

  });

  console
.
log
(
"Rolling Release Configuration Updated:"
,
result
.
rollingRelease
);

}

setRollingReleaseConfig
();

​
Approve the next stage of a rolling release

In this example, you manually approve advancing a rolling release to the next stage. This is useful when you have stages configured with
requireApproval: true
 and want to control the rollout progression.

run.ts
Copy
Ask AI
import
 {
Vercel
 }
from
 "@vercel/sdk"
;

const
 vercel

 new
 Vercel

env
.
VERCEL_TOKEN
,

});

async
 function
 approveNextStage
() {

  const
 projectId
 =
 "your-project-id"
;

  try
 {

    // First, get the current rolling release status to understand the current state

    const
 currentStatus
 =
 await
 vercel
.
rollingRelease
.
getActiveRollingRelease
({

      idOrName:

      teamId:

// Optional

    });

    if
 (

currentStatus
.
rollingRelease
 ||
 currentStatus
.
rollingRelease
.
state
 !==
 "ACTIVE"
) {

      console
.
log
(
"No active rolling release found for this project"
);

      return
;

    }

    const
 {
rollingRelease
 }
=
 currentStatus
;

    console
.
log
(
`Current stage:
${
rollingRelease
.
activeStage

);

    if
 (
!
rollingRelease
.
nextStage
) {

      console
.
log
(
"Rolling release is already at the final stage"
);

      return
;

    }

    if
 (
!
rollingRelease
.
nextStage
.
requireApproval
) {

      console
.
log
(
"Next stage does not require manual approval"
);

      return
;

    }

    // Approve advancing to the next stage

    const
 approvalResult
 =
 await

.
approveRollingReleaseStage
({

      idOrName:

      requestBody:
 {

        nextStageIndex:
 rollingRelease
.
nextStage
.
index
,

        canaryDeploymentId:
 rollingRelease
.
canaryDeployment
?.
id
 ||
 ""
,

      },

    });

    console
.
log
(
"✓ Rolling release stage approved successfully!"
);

    console
.
log
(
`Advanced to stage
${
approvalResult
.
rollingRelease
?.
activeStage

}
% traffic)`
);

    // Display updated rollout information

    if
 (

nextStage
) {

      console
.
log
(
`Next stage will be:

approvalResult
.

index
}
 (

% traffic)`
);

    }
else
 {

      console
.
log

    }

  }
catch
 (
error
) {

    console
.
error
(
"Failed to approve rolling release stage:"
,
error
);

  }

}

approveNextStage
();

​
Force completion of a rolling release

In this example, you force-complete an active rolling release, immediately promoting the canary deployment to serve 100% of traffic. This is useful for emergency situations or when you want to skip remaining stages.

run.ts
Copy

The
@vercel/sdk
 is a type-safe Typescript SDK that allows you to access the resources and methods of the Vercel REST API.

To view the methods for all endpoints, and explore code examples, see the
reference endpoints documentation
.

​
Installing Vercel SDK

To download and install Vercel SDK, run the following command:

pnpm
npm
yarn
Copy
Ask AI
pnpm
 i
 @vercel/sdk

​
Authentication

Vercel Access Tokens are required to authenticate and use the Vercel SDK.

Once you have
created a token
, you can use it to initialize the SDK as follows:

run.ts
Copy
Ask AI
import
 {
Vercel
 }
from
 '@vercel/sdk'
;

const
 vercel
 =
 new
 Vercel
({

  bearerToken:
 '<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE>'
,

});

​
Troubleshooting

Make sure that you create a token with the correct Vercel
scope
.
If you face permission (403) errors when you are already sending a token, it can be one of the following problems:

The token you are using has expired. Check the expiry date of the token in the Vercel dashboard.

The token does not have access to the correct scope, either not the right team or it does not have account level access.

The resource or operation you are trying to use is not available for that team. For example, AccessGroups is an Enterprise only feature and you are using a token for a team on the pro plan.

Using the REST API
Copy page
Interact programmatically with your Vercel account using the SDK or direct HTTP requests.
Copy page
To view all endpoints, and explore code examples with the SDK and direct API calls, see the
reference endpoints documentation
.

You can deploy new versions of web applications, manage custom domains, retrieve information about deployments, and manage secrets and environment variables for projects.

The API supports any programming language or framework that can send HTTP requests.

To interact with the API, you can:

Use the Vercel SDK
 by first instantiating with your token

Use the language of your choice by calling the endpoints directly and
providing your token

​
API Basics

Our API is exposed as an HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 service over SSL. All endpoints live under the URL
https://api.vercel.com
 and then generally follow the REST architecture.

​
Server Specs

​
HTTP and TLS

The API supports HTTP versions 1, 1.1, and 2, although HTTP/2 is preferred.

TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3 are supported, with resumption.

For more information on TLS support, refer to the SSL Labs report.

​
Content Type

All requests must be encoded as JSON with the Content-Type: application/json header. If not otherwise specified, responses from the Vercel API, including errors, are encoded exclusively as JSON as well.

​
Authentication

Vercel Access Tokens are required to authenticate and use the Vercel API.

Copy
Ask AI
  Authorization
:
Bearer
 <
TOKEN
>

​
Creating an Access Token

Access Tokens can be created and managed from inside your
account settings
.

In the upper-right corner of your
dashboard
, click your profile picture, then select
Account Settings
 or go to the
Tokens page directly

Select
Tokens
 from the sidebar

From
Create Token
 section, enter a descriptive name for the token

Choose the scope from the list of Teams in the drop-down menu. The scope ensures that only your specified Team(s) can use an Access Token

From the drop-down, select an expiration date for the Token

Click
Create Token

Once you’ve created an Access Token, securely store the value as it will not be shown again.

​
Expiration

Setting an expiration date on an Access Token is highly recommended and is considered one of the standard security practices that helps keep your information secure. You can select from a default list of expiration dates ranging from 1 day to 1 year. You can view the expiration date of your Access Tokens on the
tokens page.

​
Accessing Resources Owned by a Team

By default, you can access resources contained within your own user account (personal).

To access resources owned by a team, or create a project for a
specific
 team, you must first find the
Team ID
.

After you obtained the Team ID, append it as a query string at the end of the API endpoint URL:

Copy
Ask AI
https
:
//api.vercel.com/v6/deployments?teamId=[teamID]

​
Failed Authentication

If authentication is unsuccessful for a request, the
error status code

403
 is returned.

​
Types

The following is a list of the types of data used within the Vercel API:

Name
Definition
Example
ID
A unique value used to identify resources.
"V0fra8eEgQwEpFhYG2vTzC3K"
String
A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.
"value"
Integer
An integer is a number without decimals.
1234
Float
A float is a number with decimals.
12.34
Map
A data structure with a list of values assigned to a unique key.
{ "key": "value" }
List
A data structure with only a list of values separated by a comma.
["value", 1234, 12.34]
Enum
An Enum is a String with only a few possible valid values.
A
 or
B
Date
An Integer representing a date in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.
1540095775941
IsoDate
A String representing a date in the 8601 format.
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ
Boolean
A Boolean is a type of two possible values representing true or false.
true

​
Pagination

When the API response includes an array of records, a pagination object is returned when the total number of records present is greater than the limit per request. The default value of this limit is 20 but it can be changed by passing a value to the query parameter
limit
 when the request is made. The maximum possible value of
limit
 is 100.

You can then use the pagination object to make additional requests and obtain all the records.

The pagination object is structured as shown in the example below:

pagination-structure
Copy
Ask AI
{

  "pagination"
: {

    "count"
:
20
,
//Amount of items in the current page.

    "next"
:
1555072968396
,
//Timestamp that must be used to request the next page.

    "prev"
:
1555413045188
 //Timestamp that must be used to request the previous page.

  }

}

In order to obtain the records for the next batch, perform the following actions:

Send a request to the same API endpoint

Include the query parameter
until
 with a value equal to the timestamp value of
next
 returned in the previous request

Repeat this sequence until the pagination object has a
next
 value of
null

This is an example of applying this sequence with
Node.js
 to save all the projects in your personal account to a
json
 file:

pagination-example.js
Copy
Ask AI
const
 axios
 =
 require
(
'axios'
);

const
 fs
 =
 require
(
'fs'
);

const
 vercelToken
 =
 'yourtokenvalue'
;
//Replace with your token

const
 apiEndPt
 =
 'https://api.vercel.com/v9/projects'
;

let
 config
 =
 {

  method:
 'get'
,

  url:
 apiEndPt
,

  headers:
 {

    Authorization:
 'Bearer '
 +
 vercelToken
,

  },

};

let
 results
 =
 [];

(
function
 loop
() {

  axios
(
config
)

    .
then
(
function
 (
response
) {

      results
.
push
(
...
response
.
data
.
projects
);

      if
 (
response
.
data
.
pagination
.
next
 !==
 null
) {

        config
.
url
 =
 `
${
apiEndPt
}
?until=
${
response
.
data
.
pagination
.
next
}
`
;

        loop
();

      }
else
 {

        //you can use the final results object and for example save it to a json file

        fs
.
writeFileSync
(
'projects.json'
,
JSON
.
stringify
(
results
));

      }

    })

    .
catch
(
function
 (
error
) {

      console
.
log
(
error
);

    });

})();

​
Rate Limits

We limit the number of calls you can make over a certain period of time.
Rate limits vary and are specified by the following header in all responses:

Header
Description
X-RateLimit-Limit
The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make.
X-RateLimit-Remaining
The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
X-RateLimit-Reset
The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds.

When the rate limit is
exceeded
, an error is returned with the status “
429 Too Many Requests
”:

error-response
Copy
Ask AI
{

  "error"
: {

    "code"
:
"too_many_requests"
,

    "message"
:
"Rate limit exceeded"

  }

}

You can find the complete list of rate limits in the
limits
documentation
.

​
Versioning

All endpoints and examples are designated with a specific version. Versions vary per endpoint and are not global.

The response shape of a certain endpoint is not guaranteed to be fixed over time. In particular, we might add new keys to responses without bumping a version endpoint, which will be noted in the changelog.

To ensure the security and correctness of your application, make sure to only read the keys from the response that your application needs. Don’t proxy entire responses to third-parties without validation.

Old versions of each endpoint are supported for as long as possible. When we intend to deprecate, we will notify users in the changelog section.

Endpoint versions follow the base URL and come before the endpoint. For example:

version-endpoint
Copy
Ask AI
https
:
//api.vercel.com/v6/deployments`

This examples uses version
6
 of the
deployments
endpoint
.
